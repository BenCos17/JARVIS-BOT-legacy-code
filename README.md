My old code for J.A.R.V.I.S discord bot from years ago before I switched to using python and redbot 

The code in the zip folder is no longer fuctional and also not recommended for any new bots as it has a lot of security issues and doesn't work or start.
DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION WITHOUT UPDATING 

the other files in the repo are updated however I am bot liable for any damages that may result from using it. 

New bot is running on
https://jarvisdiscordbot.net.     
using code from here:
https://discord.red. with a custom fork though (https://github.com/JARVIS-discordbot/Red-DiscordBot-jarvis)
my custom cogs are located here:
