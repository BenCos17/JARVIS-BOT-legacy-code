My old code for J.A.R.V.I.S discord bot from years ago before I switched to using python and redbot 

No longer fuctional and also not recommended for any new bots as it has a lot of security issues and doesn't work or start.
DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION WITHOUT UPDATING 

New bot is running on
https://dashboard.jarvisdiscordbot.net.     
using code from here:
https://discord.red.         
my custom cogs are located here:
